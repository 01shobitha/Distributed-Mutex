This is to track our work for the final year project for which we have chosen the topic: Distributed Mutual exclusion. 

To begin with, we are going to implement some classical concurrency problems like

1. Reader's Writer's problem
2. Producer-consumer problem
3. Dining philosopher's problem

We are going to implement these for both parallel systems and distributed systems.
